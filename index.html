                  <h4>My Story</h4>
                  <p>
                    My passion for coding started at an extremely young age. I was 10 years old when I first wrote code for a standalone Java application.
                    At the time, I really had no Idea about the core concepts behind computer science, but I was extremely interested in video games. I would spend
                    days, weeks and months changing the look of my game's UI, me and my friends would interact over the game. I was and still am
                    obsessed with my computer, and building things. I would host a private server on my laptop, and use google to find tutorials on game development,
                    so that me and my friends could play video games together. In college, I was extremely interested in low level programming with the Arduino. The first time I finally
                    understood how the circuitry worked, I was constantly obsessing over reading the Arduino's manual and understanding every single bit on every single register.
                    When i got my first phototransistor to light up, it made my lights light up as well.

            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <div class="line-dec"></div>
            <p> In this life that I've lived, the greatest lesson that I've learned is nothing in this life is promised to you. Anyone can leave your life at any instant, you cannot control the behavior of other people, so why worry?

             It's okay to feel sad when a loved one dies, or you didn't get that promotion, or your favorite football team loses, or being sad over a girl. We as humans tend to dwell on negative emotions, but if we focus our energy on the positive emotions
             in life, we will start to live in a more grateful, and happy state. I've been blessed to have the greatest support system ever as my family, and this has increased my emotional intelligence tremendously. Being happy is a subtle feeling, and when you focus on your happiness, you see the light in every situation.

             There's no point in focusing on the negative things, every mistake I have made in life, I have learned from and made a better life from it. You need to realize that sometimes your life isn't in your control, so you can be grateful for the now. Deep meditation, journaling, and going on walks are all activities that help activate your senses to realize that you are an infinite being full of life, and that there's many great opportunities for happiness ahead. A tenant, I've learned is that the second voice in your head is always the most powerful, and to always trust your gut feeling. We as humans are generally trapped into having a scarcity mindset, when really we should have an abundance mindset. There's millions of amazing experiences
             waiting for you in this life, and when one goes wrong, it's not the end of the world. Be assertive and speak to your needs, if you are feeling needy, take. If you want something badly, demand it. Of course, values and ethics should always come into play, always, always.

             When you are following your ethics and values, is when you learn to love yourself. Forgive yourself, and be gentle. You barely own a fraction of the problems in this world, and you can't truly be happy holding anger in your heart as well. You never have to forgive someone, but as long as you accept the situation for what it is, you will start to find inner peace and joy. You do not have to be forgiven by someone, but when you forgive yourself then there is no more problem. Remember to look back at your accomplishments. Be happy, life is short.
